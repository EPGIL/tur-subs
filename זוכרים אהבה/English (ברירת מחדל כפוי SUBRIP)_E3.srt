1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,917
reminder.

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,667
[gasps]

3
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,708
[Güneş] That's not what I told you, Özgen.

4
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,583
Honey, I'm only asking.

5
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,125
If that is where this story is going,

6
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,917
you can fast-forward
through the details in between.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,083
Girl, I don't know why
I bother telling you anything.

8
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,625
Never mind her, honey.

9
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,500
You tell me. I'm all ears.

10
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:03,083
So, he boarded the plane
last minute and sat next to you.

11
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,708
Your hands were about to touch
when he chickened out

12
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,208
and leaned back?

13
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:10,833
Okay. Then what?

14
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,417
Then…

15
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,667
Then, he dozed off.

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,250
Oh… I-I was sure Deniz would
do something annoying like that.

17
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,083
My version of the story
was so much better, right?

18
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:25,417
Did you get the metaphors
about kissing while buckled up?

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,875
-You got it, right? You're a smart girl.
-[chuckles]

20
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:32,542
I mean, he's doing you a favor,
so he must make you suffer for it.

21
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,708
He has to include some drama
while doing his Good Samaritan gig. Pfft!

22
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,292
Men. What else do you expect?

23
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,000
Um… Is he with you now?

24
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,500
We just got to the hotel.

25
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,417
Oh, it's all so romantic.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,875
Yeah, yeah. Very romantic indeed.

27
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,625
[sighs] Okay. So is that all?

28
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,042
Did he sleep the whole way?

29
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,125
No. He woke up for the celebration.

30
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,583
What celebration?

31
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,125
Start from the beginning.

32
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,500
For Ms. Güneş and Mr. Deniz.

33
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,583
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

34
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,542
Pervin's doing.

35
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,917
Has it started already?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,917
We're nowhere
near Cappadocian airspace yet.

37
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,000
Um. May I ask something?

38
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,167
Will this be your first time
in Cappadocia?

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,500
-Yes.
-Oh, how romantic.

40
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,625
[chuckles] Very romantic.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,542
We need to take a video
of this for Pervin.

42
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,208
It's obvious she wants me to post it.

43
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,500
Fine, do it.

44
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,667
You need to be in it too, Deniz.

45
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,042
May I? Let me do it!

46
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,375
-Here, you hold the dog. Hold her.
-[Güneş] No…

47
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,333
-No.
-Hold the dog.

48
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,375
May Cookie make an appearance too, sir?

49
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,333
No, ma'am. No need. No need at all.

50
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,250
-[mumbles] She's really doing it.
-Um.

51
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,875
Why is he hiding his face?

52
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,417
Don't be embarrassed, son.
Don't be shy. Look here.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,333
-Why is he hiding?
-It's better he's not seen.

54
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,833
It's not because he's shy.

55
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,542
Gosh.

56
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,917
Ma'am, would you please take this
Cookie of yours?

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,292
Please. Okay. Thanks.

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,583
Thanks anyway.

59
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,667
[passenger] Good God.

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,875
[Güneş] Again…

61
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,292
-I have to ask.
-Hmm.

62
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,125
Why is he hiding his face? Is he married?

63
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,208
No. He's not.

64
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,625
So, he is your boyfriend?

65
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,167
[Beren, on phone]
So, why do you think Boran ditched you?

66
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,792
I don't know. I keep calling him,
but he doesn't pick up.

67
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,375
Is this normal?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
What if something happened to him?

69
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,542
Um… I thought maybe he saw Deniz
and backed out,

70
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,875
but…

71
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,667
He doesn't know Deniz, right?

72
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,167
Oh, whatever.
I'm glad he's out of the picture.

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,500
Maybe he didn't want to fake
being the other man anymore.

74
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,583
That's also possible.

75
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,708
I'm going to ask you something.
Is that all?

76
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,500
Is this all you have to tell us?
You with Deniz in the air.

77
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,333
Huh? Güneş?

78
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
[Beren] Güneş?

79
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,333
Honey, are you all right?

80
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,208
I'm fine. I'm fine.

81
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,833
We'll pretend we're lovers
in front of the attorney.

82
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,333
Then we'll tell him we want
to sell the house, and return. That's all.

83
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,042
Very well.
Make sure you keep us posted. Okay?

84
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,292
Yes, keep us posted.

85
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,458
Show me the house. I'm dying to see it.

86
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,375
[phone ringing]

87
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,250
-Özgen.
-[Özgen] Well done, sir.

88
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,667
Congratulations. It's done.

89
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,167
Did Deniz board the plane?

90
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,833
Oh, of course, he did.

91
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,875
I haven't been reading
romance novels for nothing.

92
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,500
Only this time,
I have no romance novels for you.

93
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,375
I also missed my flight
while trying to distract Boran.

94
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,875
Honestly, how did you pull that off?

95
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,458
-[Hakan] Make way! Make way!
-[driver] Sir.

96
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,708
-You can't stand up. It's forbidden.
-Excuse me.

97
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

98
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,125
Sir.

99
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,167
Hey, be careful. You almost ran me over.

100
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,875
I wasn't at the wheel.

101
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you all right?

102
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,542
I'm fine. Get your hands off me.

103
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,292
Unbelievable.

104
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,917
Go on, please.

105
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,958
If you don't know how
to drive a buggy then don't.

106
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,375
Unbelievable.

107
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,792
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

108
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,000
Güneş?

109
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,667
Ms. Güneş has boarded.

110
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,250
Aha. Great.

111
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,750
Uh, ticket…

112
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,458
It was on my phone…

113
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,750
It's not here.

114
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,708
May I please see your ID and your ticket?

115
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,417
Um. I'm Boran.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Boran Saygun.

117
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,333
I can't let you through without an ID.

118
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,375
It's procedure, you say.

119
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,792
That's your job, sure.

120
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,333
Hold on. I'm so sorry.

121
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,167
[phone buzzing]

122
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,000
Güneş
is calling…

123
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,792
[Özgen] You took his phone?

124
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,292
Are we the mob, Hakan?

125
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
We're not the mob.

126
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,042
We're a romantic gang.

127
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,542
I can't believe you.

128
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,167
What could I have done?
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

129
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,750
I'll return it.
It's not like I stole his phone.

130
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,958
Oh. Hold on, hold on. Deniz is calling.

131
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,125
I'll call you back.

132
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,375
-Yes?
-Huh, Hakan.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,625
Did you get my message?

134
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,917
I'm in Cappadocia.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,292
Really?
And I missed my flight waiting for you.

136
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,458
I've got something to do.

137
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,333
I need to help Güneş.
I will return soon. Okay?

138
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,750
Talk to you later.

139
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,542
[coughs] Hello.

140
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,625
Oh, hello.

141
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,042
I'm your attorney, Mahir Temiz.

142
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,167
-Güneş Güner.
-Nice to meet you.

143
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,333
Deniz Derenoglu.

144
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,833
Oh, Mr. Alpha.

145
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,458
Thank you.

146
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,625
Nice to meet you.

147
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,250
I guess you'd like
to see Ms. Mesude's property first.

148
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,583
-Please.
-Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,292
By the way…

150
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,167
Forgive me,

151
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,167
but I need to ask you
some questions related to the will.

152
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,958
It's about your relationship.
I hope that is okay.

153
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
-Sure.
-[Mahir] Hmm.

154
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,083
No problem. No… That is absolutely fine.

155
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,958
There's nothing wrong
with our relationship.

156
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,708
-Why would there be?
-No.

157
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,208
I didn't think there was a problem anyway.
It's only that…

158
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,708
[chuckles] I don't know.

159
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,083
Looking at your photos,

160
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:33,458
I thought you guys would be
a more affectionate couple.

161
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,792
But I think you have
a more formal relationship.

162
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,292
Nope.

163
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,250
[chuckles]

164
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,250
[Mahir] Yes.

165
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,833
[whispers] Don't overdo it.

166
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,500
-Please, let's go.
-Very well.

167
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,917
I'll quickly grab my bag.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,125
Certainly.

169
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,542
[breathes heavily]

170
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,333
-[Güneş] Hold my hand.
-Hmm?

171
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,750
Hold my hand.

172
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,417
What a genuine display
of affection that was.

173
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,958
Stop the banter. Keep walking.

174
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,625
Stop pulling me. I'm coming, Güneş.

175
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,250
-Walk in sync, will you?
-What?

176
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,292
Left foot, right foot. Come on.

177
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,792
You can't do it. Maybe hold my left hand?

178
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,292
-Aha. Now go.
-You're exaggerating.

179
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,417
See, it worked.

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,875
Stop it. Come on.

181
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,458
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

182
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:28,583
Let's go.

183
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,208
[Mahir] I met Ms. Mesude a year
after I moved here.

184
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,833
I came here every day for nine years.

185
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,583
She was a good person.

186
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,083
How long have you two been together?

187
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,542
-Two years.
-Two?

188
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,625
Uh-huh.

189
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,250
Two. It's not two.

190
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:49,167
Actually,
Deniz was courting me for two years.

191
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,375
We've been together for three to
three and a half years after that.

192
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,167
Yeah, two, three and a half, three years.

193
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,917
-Give or take.
-I see.

194
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,583
This is the house.

195
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,958
-What are you on about?
-Was I supposed to lie?

196
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,375
-[Mahir] Be careful not to slip.
-Yes, my love. Be careful not to slip.

197
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Careful.

198
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,458
Here.

199
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,333
[Güneş chuckles]

200
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,042
Did Ms. Mesude live here?

201
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,292
[Mahir] Yes.

202
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,000
She was a very wealthy lady.

203
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,333
-An eccentric character.
-[chuckles]

204
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,875
[Deniz] We can figure that out.
She left her house to a total stranger.

205
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,125
-[Mahir] Hmm?
-[Deniz] Hmm?

206
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,875
Honey, I think the flight
here tired you out.

207
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,625
Um. No, dear.

208
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,792
The attorney mentioned how
eccentric Ms. Mesude was.

209
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,167
I was pointing out a fact.

210
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,958
The house is expensive, but it has buyers.

211
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,708
So, can we put it
on the market immediately?

212
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,417
[Deniz] No, you can't.

213
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,250
Dear, can we talk about
this privately at home later?

214
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,250
Dear, can we talk later?

215
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,958
[mouthing] What are you doing?

216
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,417
If you want to see the house,
feel free to look around.

217
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,042
We can then proceed to the next step.

218
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,500
Ms. Mesude's itinerary as per her will.

219
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,292
-[both] Itinerary?
-Uh-huh.

220
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,292
We… We weren't told about an itinerary.
We only know about the house.

221
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,042
Will there be a ceremony or what?
[chuckles]

222
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,875
As I pointed out,
Ms. Mesude was quite eccentric.

223
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,083
[Mahir] Hmm. Um.

224
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,958
[murmurs]

225
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,125
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

226
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,625
Ah.

227
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,833
And this is a letter from
Ms. Mesude to the lovers.

228
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,583
[Deniz] Uh-huh.

229
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,875
For you. Here.

230
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,750
Sure. Thank you.

231
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,583
Since you're lovers.

232
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,292
Um. [clears throat] Uh-huh.

233
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,250
-My love.
-Hmm. Darling.

234
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,917
My sweetheart.

235
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,708
Honeybunch.

236
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,583
-[whispers] Easy.
-Okay.

237
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,792
What letter? What is this all about?

238
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,250
Why do you agree to everything?
I don't get it.

239
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,667
We don't have to agree to anything.

240
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,792
Especially you.

241
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,542
Tell me, why did you come
with me in the first place?

242
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,292
Why did you join me if you
were going to be so difficult?

243
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,750
You know I'm terrible
at playing tricks, Güneş.

244
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,000
As if I'm a pro at it.

245
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,458
I asked the bellhop if he had a girlfriend
and told him I had a boyfriend.

246
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,583
The poor boy forgot his tip
and dashed out of the room.

247
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,333
Stop overdoing it.

248
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,042
Do you think we can put the house
on the market tomorrow?

249
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
No, it's not going to be that easy.

250
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,125
Why?

251
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,375
The house is of historical value.

252
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,875
You can't do anything to it.

253
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,208
I'm telling you, it won't be easy to sell.

254
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,000
But consider yourself lucky.
You're here with an architect.

255
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, lucky me.
I'm here with an architect.

256
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,875
Deniz, did you just come here
to help me sell the house?

257
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,542
Is there no other motive?

258
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,292
I wanted to help your sister out.

259
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,000
What other motive could I have?

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,750
I don't know.

261
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,333
[Deniz sighs]

262
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:26,000
[softly] Geez.

263
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,875
What are you doing?

264
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,208
I was hoping to take a shower.

265
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,375
I-I need to work on my article.
Get undressed next door.

266
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,042
Why? Am I distracting you?

267
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,292
Feeling confused?

268
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,667
Stare at the fairy chimneys
over there and start typing.

269
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,625
Do whatever you want, okay?

270
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,708
Do whatever you want.

271
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,292
I will do that.

272
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,208
[sighs]

273
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,000
[singing "Asktan Ne Haber"]

274
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,500
[singing continues]

275
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,167
[audience cheers, whistles]

276
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,750
[giggling]

277
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,000
We did it! [laughs]

278
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,167
We did good. Real good.

279
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,375
-Amazing. Huh? What do you think?
-It was very good. It was great.

280
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,583
-We didn't embarrass ourselves either.
-Right? I think everyone enjoyed it.

281
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:57,667
Yeah.

282
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,000
-Thank you.
-[Deniz] Bravo. Bravo.

283
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,875
-Bravo.
-Bravo.

284
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,708
-Was it bad?
-You did quite well, darling.

285
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:05,208
-Don't be silly. It was very good.
-It was good, right?

286
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,292
I honestly didn't hear any of it.

287
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,500
You're up next.

288
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,667
-I'm singing too? No, she's joking.
-You will sing.

289
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,250
You will sing.

290
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,750
Everyone in here sings.

291
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,167
-What kind of rule is that? No way.
-You will.

292
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,250
[Beren] Listen.

293
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,250
We were thinking of leaving,
but I guess you're staying on.

294
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,292
Yes. Deniz will serenade me.

295
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,625
-[Beren] Seriously?
-Yeah.

296
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,125
[Beren] Uh-oh.

297
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,750
-[Deniz] Yeah.
-Why don't you do things like that, Ozan?

298
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,542
-Serenade?
-Yes. To me.

299
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,583
Me, serenading?

300
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,000
-Really?
-Yes.

301
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,458
[chuckles]

302
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,667
I'm bored.

303
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,042
Let's go.

304
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,958
-Fine. All right then. Let's bail.
-[Ozan] It's best we go, bro.

305
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:42,083
-Give me my bag, dear.
-[Ozan] Here.

306
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,125
-Kisses for you all.
-See you.

307
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,667
Sorry, man.

308
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,167
Good night.

309
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,792
This guy is such a buzz-kill.

310
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,292
Exactly.

311
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,500
I mean, the more I see him,
the more I like Deniz.

312
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,583
No, don't say that.

313
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,750
I can and I will. I'm leaving, too.

314
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,000
I will find myself a man
who will serenade me.

315
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,417
-[laughs]
-You guys are so boring.

316
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,250
-Good luck.
-Oh, see.

317
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,792
[laughs]

318
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,875
Oh, come on. Sing.

319
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,167
It's really not my thing. I can't sing.

320
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,708
You can. What if we found a song you like?

321
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,958
I'm telling you, I can't.

322
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,958
Please, you didn't even look. Come.

323
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,625
You choose, you sing.

324
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,583
I'm a great listener. Let me listen.

325
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,417
-You want me to sing for you?
-Sing for me.

326
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,083
-Should I?
-Which song?

327
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,167
Let me pick one.

328
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,917
-Surprise? All right.
-Surprise.

329
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,958
Can I get another one?

330
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,083
[bartender] Sure thing.

331
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,750
[singing "Saz Mı Caz Mı?"]

332
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:23,500
[singing continues]

333
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,667
Wow, you can sing.
Come, let's sing together.

334
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,083
It's no fun alone. Come over.

335
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,958
Come on. Stop playing around.
Don't do this.

336
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:18,583
Ooh!

337
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,958
You're turning me on, baby.

338
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,917
[patrons gasp]

339
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,917
[patron] Come here!

340
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,083
[groans]

341
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,750
[Ms. Mesude] Dear Güneş.

342
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,708
If you are reading this letter,

343
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,083
it means that I've
already become a flower.

344
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,375
I've become rain.

345
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,250
I've become one with the valley.

346
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you for coming.

347
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:55,042
As my end nears, I found solace
in your writing and in your love affair.

348
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,875
The skilled people of this land

349
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:03,583
have passed down their prowess
to future generations.

350
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,958
Or, lent a hand, if you will.

351
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:10,375
I have always believed that
the ability to love is also a skill.

352
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:17,292
I see that you not only have that skill
but also inspire others.

353
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,458
That is also what you did for me.

354
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:26,250
In my final moments of despair,
you rekindled my dying hopes.

355
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,250
-So, I wanted you to have…
-…my most precious possession.

356
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,917
My antiquated house.

357
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,958
But before that, if you agree,

358
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,417
I'd like to take you on a short journey.

359
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,208
This will be my way of defining love
to you, just like you do in your articles.

360
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:47,875
[Ms. Mesude] I am confident that your love
will give life to this place

361
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:54,333
and that you will see love
from my perspective as you proceed.

362
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:58,542
I will reach out to you
with a letter at every stop.

363
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,875
I hope you take this trip.

364
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,500
Mesude.

365
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,333
Güneş.

366
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,042
[phone ringing]

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,500
[sighs]

368
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,417
-Mr. Rauf.
-Deniz.

369
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,750
What business do we have
with houses in Cappadocia, Deniz?

370
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,125
I understand you inquired
about the heritage status of one.

371
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,750
Um, yes. Well.

372
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:52,083
I mean, I wanted to get some advice
from our guys about this inheritance case.

373
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,250
I heard that you didn't
go to London, Deniz.

374
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,000
Uh… More like I couldn't.

375
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,417
Unfortunately, I missed my flight,
so I postponed it.

376
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,583
Deniz, listen.
I told you at the last meeting.

377
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:05,292
Your private life is your own business.

378
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm fond of Güneş, too.

379
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,292
You're my most experienced architect.

380
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,208
I want to trust you on this London job.

381
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:16,500
Um, of course, Mr. Rauf. You can.
You can trust me.

382
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:20,750
Then I won't ask you what was so
important that you postponed the meeting.

383
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,333
Time is not on our side.

384
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:27,125
If you say so, I guess I don't need
to call you about it again.

385
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,250
Like I said, you can trust me.
Okay, Mr. Rauf.

386
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,333
Okay. See you.

387
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,625
Okay.

388
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,417
[sighs]

389
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,000
Here goes.

390
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,000
Shall I come over?

391
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,375
I'm coming. I can't hear you.

392
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,417
Okay. I'm coming.

393
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,042
[no audible dialogue]

394
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,333
[Özgen] I'm coming.

395
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,042
-[Hakan] …would be better.
-Really?

396
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,250
Hakan.

397
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,417
Özgen.

398
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,375
Who is this woman?

399
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,625
Özgen, calm down.

400
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,125
Um, excuse me. What's going on?
Who are you?

401
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,542
What's with the attitude? I don't get it.

402
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,750
-Özgen.
-Özgen, what?

403
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,125
Don't you dare call me Özgen. Shut up.

404
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,083
Tell me her real name now,
or I'll have to start name-calling.

405
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,500
You are so rude.

406
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,333
Are you juggling two women?

407
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,542
I can't believe
what is happening right now.

408
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,625
[Özgen]
What's done is done. That's too bad.

409
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,917
Get up and leave already.

410
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,792
I'm sorry, but I won't let you use him.

411
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,458
You're such a cheap bitch!

412
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:59,583
Sorry, but I can't build a future with
a man who dates women like her, Hakan.

413
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:01,125
Beste, wait a minute.

414
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,875
-Beste--
-Beat it, Beste. Stop dawdling.

415
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,583
Make it quick, Beste.

416
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,667
[laughs] That was great.

417
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,583
Özgen, what have you done?

418
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,458
I genuinely liked her.

419
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,833
-What?
-Özgen.

420
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:15,542
What did you do, Özgen?

421
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,583
[exhales heavily]

422
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,583
Why were you making those faces, then?

423
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,000
You beckoned me in.

424
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,792
I was telling you not to come in.

425
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,208
Not to come in? You beckoned me.
I saw you from over there.

426
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:30,125
Okay, fine. Let's go and explain.
Let's tell her it was all a sick joke.

427
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,250
Actually, let me do it.

428
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,125
Don't you dare. What will we tell her?

429
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,958
My buddy Özgen waits close by
to cut my dates short

430
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,292
when the women are boring, eh?

431
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,542
What excuse could there be?

432
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:40,792
No, we can't tell her that.

433
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,958
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

434
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,458
I'm so sorry.

435
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,542
Uh-oh. Why am I the one apologizing here?

436
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,667
Why should I be sorry?
Didn't you hear what she called me?

437
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,583
Well, you were the one name-calling.

438
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,750
Beste was different.

439
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,417
Hmm.

440
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,292
Oh, Beste was different, huh?

441
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,333
Are you on her side?

442
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,667
Özgen, I said I liked her.
What don't you get?

443
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,542
You liked her?

444
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,000
Congratulations.

445
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,458
You ruined everything.

446
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,500
I rarely like someone.

447
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,500
She was nice.

448
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Now she's gone.

449
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,167
[sighs]

450
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,458
[knocks on door]

451
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,750
[door opens]

452
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,875
Aha, Deniz.

453
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,583
Mesude gave us
some addresses in her letter.

454
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,375
I wish she had given us the title deed
and saved us all this trouble.

455
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,292
-Are you all right? Is something wrong?
-I'm fine. Just fine.

456
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,375
Which addresses?

457
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,000
Her will states that we
must visit these addresses.

458
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,042
I guess it's some kind of itinerary.

459
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,500
As a couple.

460
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,875
She probably wanted us to visit them
as a couple, Güneş.

461
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,000
Weren't we supposed to sell
the house and go back?

462
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,917
Deniz, she has left us a house.

463
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,750
We owe her that much, right?

464
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,667
Güneş, be honest with me.

465
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,375
How long will we keep playing
a stranger's game?

466
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:09,208
Yes, I realize you have things to do,
but I want to go through with it.

467
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,125
I'm not comfortable
acquiring the house as it is.

468
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,583
At least we'll honor a few wishes.
What's wrong with that?

469
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:16,083
I get it,
but how long will these games last?

470
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:20,250
Listen. Let's tell the attorney that I'm
an architect and sell the house.

471
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,750
What about that?

472
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,833
What about this?

473
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,250
You stay here, and I go alone.

474
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,708
[sighs]

475
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,708
All right, wait up.

476
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:30,458
I'm coming.
I'm coming with you, please wait.

477
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,833
[lounge pop-style music playing]

478
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,667
[Hakan] Mr. Boran?

479
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:47,042
-Fikret, right?
-Um, yes. I'm Fikret.

480
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,292
Where's my wallet?

481
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,417
Um. Here.

482
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,167
I'm sorry. There's been a mix-up.

483
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,292
I'm no pickpocket.

484
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,417
Really?

485
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,792
How much?

486
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,125
How much for what?

487
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,458
You found my phone and wallet.
How much do you want? Tell me.

488
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,750
No. You've got this all wrong.
That's not the case.

489
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,083
Enough with the games.

490
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,417
You're terrible at it.

491
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,792
Name your price. I'll pay you.

492
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,667
Pretending to bump into me and all.
It was all staged.

493
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,000
What is all this about?

494
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,750
Bro, are you asking for trouble?

495
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,750
Look, I brought you
your stuff in good faith. Stop it.

496
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,375
Oh, really? Who knows what you're up to?

497
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,750
Maybe you looked me up on the Internet.

498
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:27,167
You saw I was wealthy,
and now you're here to milk me.

499
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,625
So, you don't know
I'm the son of a media mogul.

500
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,750
Yeah, right.
The Good Samaritan to the rescue.

501
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,542
What are you talking about?

502
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:37,333
I don't give a damn
about who you are, man.

503
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,417
-Listen here.
-What the hell?

504
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,125
Now my girlfriend is alone in Cappadocia.
She went without me all because of you.

505
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,500
I missed my flight too.

506
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,833
Where were you going?

507
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:46,958
London.

508
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,833
More lies. What were you doing
in the domestic lounge then?

509
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,500
Um. I was trying to get to
international departures.

510
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah, right. Pfft. Unbelievable.

511
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,667
Whoa. Are you counting your money?

512
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:10,417
What? I thought money
wasn't an issue, Fikret?

513
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,417
-Boran.
-Huh?

514
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,542
Seems you're trying to pick a fight.

515
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,208
You want me to punch you in the face?

516
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,083
What kind of person are you?

517
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,583
Look!

518
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,667
[instructor] One hand on the inside,
the other on the outside.

519
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,833
That's how you hold it.

520
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,083
Now, pull up.

521
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:33,458
Please help her. She looks so clumsy.
I doubt she can do it.

522
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:36,042
In-In here… Throw it in here.

523
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,750
-It's okay if it gets a little messy.
-[instructor] Release your foot.

524
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,125
Take it aside for now.

525
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,333
-[Deniz] Do that.
-[instructor] Don't leave it spinning…

526
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,875
Bring it up. Excellent.

527
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,000
Can't you see it? It's all wavy.

528
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,083
As if yours is straight.

529
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,583
-Leave me alone.
-It's quite smooth.

530
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,792
Now you've totally messed it up.

531
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,250
There.

532
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,042
-See.
-[speaks indistinctly]

533
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,000
-My goodness.
-What if I do this, huh?

534
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,292
[instructor] Ms. Mesude's letter.

535
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,583
Thank you.

536
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,625
[dial tone]

537
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,625
She's not answering.

538
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,833
-[Hakan] Who isn't answering?
-She's not.

539
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,208
Who isn't answering?

540
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,042
Huh?

541
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:43,000
Güneş. My girlfriend.

542
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,000
Doesn't she care
what happened to me, Fikret? Huh?

543
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,042
What? Well, I don't think so.

544
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,542
I saw 15 missed calls from Güneş on there.

545
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,917
Why didn't you answer?

546
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,708
You should have told her you took
my phone at the airport by mistake.

547
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:00,625
Well, you could have called your
girlfriend before counting your money.

548
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,208
[sighs] Fikret.

549
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,125
[chuckles] Man.

550
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,083
Hmm. Come closer.

551
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,375
Listen up.

552
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,292
Now comes the crucial question.

553
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,958
You…

554
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:25,042
When was the last time you did something
for someone, expecting nothing in return?

555
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,458
Though I doubt you would do
anything of the kind.

556
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:33,875
Or has someone ever done
something for you expecting nothing?

557
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,292
Aha. Of course.

558
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,167
Sure.

559
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,958
If someone is doing something
without any expectation,

560
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,625
it means they care about you.

561
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,667
Take me, for example.
I care about Güneş so much.

562
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:49,958
Right.

563
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,708
They care.

564
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,708
Come closer. Closer, I said.
One more thing.

565
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,458
What about this?

566
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,167
Just one word…

567
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,250
Is it enough for you to go out
of your way to help her?

568
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:08,000
Or would someone rush
over to you in the middle of the night

569
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,292
to save you from another girl?

570
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,083
-Right?
-Of course.

571
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:16,708
If you find someone like that,
you treasure her, Fikret.

572
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,917
It's important.

573
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,750
You're right, man.

574
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,542
I let Özgen down.

575
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,875
Huh? It happens, bro.

576
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,042
No one is perfect.

577
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,708
[stammers, chuckles]

578
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,458
Take me, for example.

579
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,500
Do you know where I proposed to her?

580
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,875
-At a retirement home.
-No way.

581
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,083
-Don't rub it in.
-Dude! [laughs]

582
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,708
A terrible choice. Really.

583
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,708
[sighs]

584
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,250
Wait. Hold on. I'm going.

585
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,375
I'm going to Cappadocia.

586
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,250
I'm going to propose again.

587
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,792
Yeah. Get out of here.

588
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,875
I'm going.

589
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,625
-We'll be in touch, buddy. Okay?
-Sure thing.

590
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,208
-Well, take care.
-[Hakan] Keep in touch.

591
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,375

[song continuing]

595
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,208
You can't be serious.

596
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,292
Come on, please.

597
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,583
[Güneş] Okay, okay.

598
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,500
This is the place.

599
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,083
Oh.

600
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,500
Isn't it stunning?

601
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,583
Really.

-Hello.

00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,542
Hello. Welcome.

…were formed by erosion.

607
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:56,625
Others suggest that lava
from Mount Erciyes was

608
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:00,333
carved by wind
and water over the centuries.

[song stops]

610
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,083
Ms. Mesude's letter for you.

611
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,542
Thank you.

612
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,000
[sighs]

613
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,292
Won't you open it?

614
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:29,750
Ever since I received the first letter, I
have wondered if I'll end up like Mesude.

615
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,792
Are you afraid of becoming rich enough
to leave a house to a total stranger?

616
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,875
[sighs]

617
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,250
No. Of being alone.

618
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:43,792
So alone that you leave your house
and all your memories to a total stranger.

619
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,417
You aren't alone. You have me.

620
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,292
What happens when we return?

621
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,500
Won't we go our separate ways?

622
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,458
[breathes deeply, sighs]

623
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,750
Mesude is so eloquent.

624
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,333
Won't we eventually get off
the hot air balloon we're traveling in?

625
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,375
Come on. Let's first jump in one
and remember how it feels to fly.

626
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,375
That was a metaphor.

627
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,292
Is that the gist you got from it?

628
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,417
Wait.

629
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,583

Are you serious?

632
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,208
[Deniz] I'm dead serious.

633
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,833
So, we're really doing it.

634
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:47,167
[Deniz] Exactly.

635
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,208
You're opening up to this adventure.

636
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,417
Sure.

637
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,292
Wait.

638
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,292
Excuse me. Isn't the flame too strong?

639
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,250
[Güneş] Never mind that. Just look around.

640
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:10,625
I'm pretty sure it would still ascend
even if you dialed it down a little.

641
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:15,125
It's all part of the show.
What's the big deal?

642
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,958
-I don't get it.
-Oh, you're so grouchy.

643
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,500
Look around you.
You can't deny the beauty of the scenery.

645
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,333
See that? It's incredible.

00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,792

You look amazing.

Thank you.

00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,375
You're not bad yourself.

654
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,042
Let me remind you that Mahir
will have his eyes on us tonight.

655
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,792
No doubt.
I'm sure that's why we're guests of honor.

656
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,542
Have you seen him? Where is he?

657
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,792
He's over there, flirting with someone.

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,125
Check out Mahir's moves.

659
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,708
Has he found someone?

660
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:25,333
That's nice.
Maybe he'll leave us alone tonight.

661
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,167
We could do with it.

662
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,042
Wow. That's love over there.

663
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,917
Oh, seriously?

664
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,083
Pe-Pervin. That's Pervin.

-Who?
-Pervin is here. Pervin!

Oh, excuse me.

What's up?

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,208
We're fine. You?

671
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,625
Do you know each other?

672
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,708
We met thanks to you. [chuckles]

673
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,542
We kind of got closer while
organizing your trip.

674
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,792
We're just as surprised.

675
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:04,250

and sending photos to each other.

-Sensational, right? [laughs]

-Aw. Fingers crossed for us.

for the article.

00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,583
I don't want any trouble tonight.

701
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,458
The night is long, Güneş.
You are full of surprises.

702
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,292
Trouble is my middle name, Deniz.

703
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,708
Come on then.

704
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,833
Up for a dance?

705
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,708
I'll hold your hand so you don't fall.

706
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,958
I won't. You'll catch me.

707
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,375
["You're In Danger" playing]

708
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,333
[patrons cheer]

709
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,792
[song continuing]

710
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,208
Bravo!

711
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,042
Bravo! Bravo!

712
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,792
[song ends]

713
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:40,042
[Güneş] Some moves you've got.

714
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,833
Hopefully he thinks we're lovers now.

715
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:47,750
So this was a show?
Was it about appearances?

716
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:49,875
No.

717
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,292
I'm saying I'm glad we're here.

718
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:08,458
We can go back to Istanbul
tomorrow if someone is waiting for you.

719
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,375
There is someone I've been
meaning to part ways with.

720
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,458
If we stay any longer,
we will see the hot air balloons

721
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,750
at dawn on our way to the hotel.

722
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:29,958
Then let's do that.

723
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,833
Seriously?

724
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:34,875
[chuckles] I'm serious and very drunk.

725
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,000
All right then.

726
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:39,333
Let's see the hot air balloons drunk.

727
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,958
I have a confession.

728
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,583
I won't remember it tomorrow
because I'm so hammered.

729
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:23,958
[chuckles]

730
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,250
Okay.

731
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,542
I was hoping you would come.

732
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,833
I'm glad you did.

733
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,542
Then I have a confession too.

734
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,292
I listened to the podcast.

735
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,875
[sighs]

736
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,667
Won't you say anything?

737
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:58,042
You've already listened
to what I have to say.

738
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,792
You had no problem talking to the host
and all those listeners.

739
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,083
Oh, Deniz. Where is this going?

740
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,792
Is it about other people
in our lives again?

741
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,958
No, no. It's nothing like that.
I didn't mean that. Um…

742
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,667
I loved it. A lot.

743
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,583
I mean, I really liked the podcast.

744
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,083
Thank you.

745
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,750
This may be the first time you've
appreciated something I've done.

746
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:32,958
[chuckles] So, where is this going?
Me not approving what you do again?

747
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:34,792
-Really?
-[chuckles] No.

748
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:48,583
That day at the park.

749
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:55,417
I will never forget tonight,
just like that day at the park.

750
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,792
[phone buzzing]

751
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,125
BORAN

752
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:15,292
-[button clicks]
-[buzzing stops]

753
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,083
[clears throat]

754
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,833
We really got caught up in this game.

755
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,625
We convinced the attorney.
Mesude's game is over.

756
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,250
We can go back to Istanbul today, huh?

757
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,458
-Deniz, hold on.
-Uh… What should we…

758
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:35,042
Let's sleep on it.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

759
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,250
I'll take the couch.

760
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,875
Get some rest. Good night.

761
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,458
Deniz.

762
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,083
Deniz.

763
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,250
[sighs]

764
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,125
Deniz.

765
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,167
Wait up. Can we talk?

766
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,917
[sighs]

767
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,083
Güneş. Um…

768
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,542
I'm not up for it right now.

769
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,458
Can we talk later?

770
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:20,250
[passenger] So he is your lover?

771
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,458
Why did you come, Deniz?

772
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,000
I wanted to help your sister.

773
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,417
You declined. So, here I am.

774
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,500
I wanted to be with you.

775
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,583
I'm here.

776
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,625
[Boran] Güneş.

777
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:55,583
Boran.

778
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,708
[tense music playing]

779
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,375
I didn't want you to be alone.

780
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:05,833
What's wrong?

781
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,583
Aren't you happy to see me?

782
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,583
I told them we were lovers,
but they didn't believe me.

783
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:15,417
Please can you get the keys to our room?

784
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,750
I'm so exhausted.

785
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,833
[tense music builds]
