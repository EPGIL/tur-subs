00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,292
I'm late. I'm late again.

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,208
I'm going to miss my flight.

REMINDER: FLIGHT TO CAPPADOCIA
14:00

6
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:12,792
My bag? Where…

7
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,250
Is my bag in there?

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,708
Hey! Can't you hear me?

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,125
Taxi.

10
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,417
Deniz, can't you hear me?

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,542
-I'm telling you I'm running late.
-Oh, that's a surprise.

12
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,792
Please call me a taxi.

13
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,125
I'm busy getting ready.

14
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,917
I will take you to the airport.

15
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,958
-[Güneş] Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,458
Then hold on.

17
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,417
You earned this.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Earned what?

19
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,042
-Uh-oh.
-[chuckles]

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,458
Mister? Where's the Alpha?

21
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,625
[inhales sharply]
Then please allow me to thank you…

22
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,250
properly. We have time.

23
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,417
-No, because I'm really late.
-Listen to me.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,625
Trust me, will you?

25
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,875
-Just trust me.
-Deniz, I haven't finished packing yet.

26
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,750
-Will you let go?
-I won't.

27
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,750
No way. First, fly with me,

28
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,042
and then I'll make sure
you catch all your flights. I promise.

29
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,208
-[chuckles] Oh, really?
-Don't worry. Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:11,208
-I said no. Let go. [chuckles]
-Are you serious?

31
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:12,708
No chance.

32
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:13,792
Listen.

33
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:19,125
If you miss this flight, I promise
I'll make sure you catch the next one.

34
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,250
-[kisses]
-Not happening.

35
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,417
-Seriously?
-Uh-huh.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
[kisses]

37
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:28,250
Think it over and let me know.

38
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,125
I'll be waiting for you down here.

39
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,208
[kisses] Okay?

40
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,958
[kissing]

41
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,417
[Güneş sighs]

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,625
-Fine.
-Hmm.

43
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,708
We'll take the motorbike again.

44
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,792
Yes.

45
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,500
Yes, the motorbike it is.

00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,083
[music continues]

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,542
[Beren] Psst.

49
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,708
[Beren snaps fingers]

50
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,833
Did you see the comments
about Mr. Alpha under the photo?

51
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,250
I did,
but I can't bring myself to read them.

52
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,667
I regret what I did.

53
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,500
I literally lied to all my followers.

54
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,625
What about poor Boran? [sighs]

55
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,083
What's his take on this charade?

56
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,333
-I don't know.
-[Beren] Gosh!

57
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:21,833
Listen to her. Boran doesn't get
half the sympathy strangers get.

58
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,375
Well, it seemed like a solution at first.

59
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,875
I mean, no one has ever seen
Mr. Alpha anyway.

60
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,417
I thought I could go
and acquire the house with Boran.

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,333
We wouldn't even need
to pretend to be lovers.

62
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,167
Oh! Oh, I'm losing it.

63
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,875
First, she puts on the ring
to keep his grandma happy.

64
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,292
Now she says she's taking Boran
to acquire the house. [chuckles]

65
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,917
[scoffs] What the heck, Beren?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,833
I posted it on a whim.

67
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,250
By the time I gathered my thoughts,
it was too late.

68
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,958
-[scoffs]
-And this is your rational self now?

69
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,625
Absolutely not. Am I happy?
No. And I'm clueless about what to do.

70
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,917
If you think about it,
things don't look that bad.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,917
Hear me out.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,167
You're going to sell that house
and pay for Ayça's tuition.

73
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,458
Um, I mean, maybe if you tell Boran,
he might even chip in. Won't he?

74
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,042
What am I supposed to tell him?

75
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,583
"Come with me to Cappadocia
and tell everyone you're Mr. Alpha"?

76
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,958
What will I do in Cappadocia? Tell me.

77
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:11,292
Honey, you'll be taking a free vacation.
Plus, you get the house for free.

78
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,000
I mean,
don't be such a drama queen about it.

79
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,125
[sighs] I need to talk to Boran.

80
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,750
I don't get this relationship. Honestly.

81
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,708
What's so difficult about breaking up
with a man you don't even love that much?

82
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:27,167
Why in the world would he propose
to someone he hasn't even slept with?

83
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,792
-Oh, is this the Middle Ages or what?
-Oh! [scoffs] Men.

84
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,458
-There are great men too.
-Let's say he proposed.

85
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,667
-Why is she wearing the ring? Why?

00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,125
[shushes]

87
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,833
Gosh!
I regret telling both of you any of this.

88
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,542
Listen to me. Stop talking to us
and sort things out with Boran. [laughs]

89
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,500
Shut up! Enough. This is no place
to talk about this stuff! Zip it.

90
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,875
[Özgen] It's good we talked about it now.

91
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,250
We would still be talking about it
at your wedding otherwise. [laughs]

92
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,333
[laughs]

93
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,417
-At least the ring is off. [laughs]
-[laughing] Exactly.

94
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,750
I must talk to Boran urgently.

95
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,792
You have something much more urgent to do.
Finishing that article for the magazine.

96
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,375
-Oh! And I have that too.
-[Özgen chuckles]

97
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,583
Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,833
Maybe I should write about
what I've been through…

99
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,333
Like Deniz told me to.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
[Özgen laughing]

101
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
-[Beren] Geez. Oh, no.
-What?

102
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,208
-Cough up. [laughs]
-Come on!

103
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,250
What are you doing?

104
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,250
How much was it?

105
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,208
-[Beren] Here.
-[Özgen] Was it 200?

106
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,667
-Oh, that's not much. [laughs]
-[Beren] Yes, it was 200. Beat it.

107
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,917
-[sighs]
-Hold on now.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,417
Did you bet on how many times
I would mention Deniz?

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,833
[laughing] Stop that.

110
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,292
She hasn't a clue. Cough up.

111
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,792
I don't believe you.

112
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,500
[Hakan] Can you believe it?

113
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,125
[Deniz] What?

114
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,458
Güneş, man. Geez.

115
00:04:55,542 --> 00:05:00,208
Posting a photo in another man's arms
as if it were you.

116
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,375
Look, I've got enough on my mind
as it is, so back off.

117
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,792
What's on your mind, bro?

118
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,875
Numbers.

119
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,458
Like, can we make this work or not?

120
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,542
Work what?

121
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,708
The chain stores, Hakan.

122
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,125
Deniz, are you okay?

123
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,458
We just shook hands.

124
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:19,292
The guys haven't even left the building,
and here you are, racking your brain.

125
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,500
Chill, man. I will take care of
the construction site. We got this.

126
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,708
We need something.

127
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Something to outdo our rivals.

128
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,833
When I visit London,

129
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:31,125
I will visit some stores
and prepare a feasibility report for you.

130
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,792
What does that mean?
Am I not going to London?

131
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,500
You're going to Cappadocia, bro.
You said you checked in.

132
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,583
No, man.

133
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,417
I got carried away back there.
I'm not going. It's pointless.

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,833
You got carried away seeing Güneş
in another man's arms, right?

135
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,750
-Hakan, enough already.
-[laughs]

136
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,167
Well, if you're so pumped up about it,
you should go.

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,417
Love makes a man jealous. Look at me.

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,208
I wish I were in love and felt that way.

139
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,875
-[sighs]
-[phone ringing]

140
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,167
Damn.

141
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,792
What's the matter, Ege?
In trouble at school again?

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

143
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,208
-What is it?
-Where are you?

144
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,250
Okay. Wait there.

145
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,792
-What?
-It's nothing.

146
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,292
-Should I come with you?
-No, no.

147
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,042
Ege.

148
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,667
Here comes my Güneş.

149
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,458
What are you doing here?

150
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,667
Is something wrong?

151
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,042
How did you get here?

152
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,958
I got off the school bus with Pelin.

153
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:30,958
I left her at her house and walked here
to see you, Güneş.

154
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,583
Wow.

155
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,417
So, your parents don't know you're here?

156
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,083
Let's keep them out of this, Güneş.

157
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,667
I don't want to cause another argument
for no reason.

158
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,792
Do they still argue a lot?

159
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,792
They argue a lot.

160
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,458
I need a loving environment to grow up in.

161
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,500
-Speaking of love…
-Hmm.

162
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,500
Deniz broke up with that girl.

163
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,500
I think we should call your mother.

164
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,958
Let's tell her you'll be late
so she doesn't worry.

165
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,208
No need.

166
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,750
I called Deniz.

167
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,083
He's coming to pick me up.

168
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,417
Well, look at you, clever boy.

169
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,792
How did you think of calling Deniz?

170
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,625
Hmm.

171
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,167
-Um.
-Hmm?

172
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,458
-Pelin is a year older than me.
-Yeah.

173
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,167
-She's this much taller than me.
-[Güneş] Who is this Pelin?

174
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,042
Tell me. Is she beautiful?

175
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,125
[Deniz] Ege.

176
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,708
So you're done harassing me.

177
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,042
Is Güneş your next victim?

178
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,708
You decided to drop by like this?

179
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,750
-I miss Güneş. I thought I'd see her.
-Hmm.

180
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,250
Did you miss her too?

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,208
Kid…

182
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,583
Take your time.

183
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,667
I'll be waiting in the car.

184
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
You can drop by
whenever you want to, okay?

185
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,458
[Ege] We'll see.

186
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,542
No promises.

187
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,625
All this has been exhausting.

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,250
-[Güneş chuckles]
-[clicks tongue]

189
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,208
He really has missed you.
He kept asking about you.

190
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,875
[sighs] I missed him too.

191
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,792
I'll make sure to see him soon,
but he shouldn't come alone.

192
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,708
Maybe you could bring him.

193
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,542
I'm kind of busy lately,
but we'll sort something out.

194
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,375
Okay.

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,917
Didn't you want to have a word?

196
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh…

197
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,583
I took care of that
since we didn't get to talk the other day.

198
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,500
-You took care of it?
-Uh-huh.

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,417
There is no need for me?

200
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,000
Not anymore.

201
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,083
So it's resolved.

202
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,833
Great.

203
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,000
If you've figured it out, I mean.

204
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,375
Okay then, Güneş.

205
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,125
-Deniz.
-Hmm?

206
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,208
That heavy box the courier left…

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Can you have it collected at some point?

208
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,292
[clicks tongue]

209
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,000
Why don't you take a look inside
that heavy box?

210
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
I won't.

211
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,208
I can't. I can't open it.

212
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,125
Come and collect it.
Do whatever you want with it.

213
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,417
Fine, I don't want it either.

214
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,250
Throw it away.
Get rid of it. It's up to you.

215
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,917
Come and do it yourself.

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I said it was heavy. It's this big.

217
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,125
-Besides, I can't be bothered.
-Then don't.

218
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,875
-I won't.
-Fine. Don't.

219
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,208
By the way, I hope you don't mind
me bothering you, Güneş.

220
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,292
[huffs] Enough already.

221
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
Enough. Exactly.

222
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,125
Have a nice day.

223
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,167
[sighs]

224
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,208
Someone has left us a house.

225
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,292
[sighs]

226
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,500
Pervin texted you.

227
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,917
You probably never saw it.

228
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,167
A lonely woman left us her house
in Cappadocia.

229
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,750
She left it to you, not me.

230
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,792
Sorry, to Mr. Alpha and you.

231
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,375
[sighs]

232
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,917
Yes, but she has a condition.

233
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,250
To claim the house,

234
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,292
we must convince the lawyer
that we are still together.

235
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,375
Hmm.

236
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,417
But we aren't.

237
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,542
How is that going to work out?

238
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,042
I was thinking…

239
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,833
What if we took a few photos?

240
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,500
-Then saw the lawyer there…
-We're back to where we started.

241
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,333
I've told you a million times.

242
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,875
I don't want anything to do with
this influencer stuff.

243
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,500
And you will never make me
lie to a lawyer I haven't even met.

244
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,917
What does that even mean?

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,708
It's important to me, okay?

246
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,125
Besides, what harm can a few photos do?

247
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,333
Is it that hard? What's so wrong?

248
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,250
-A few photos?
-Yes.

249
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,542
-Fake ones.
-Yes.

250
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,458
Hmm.

251
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,833
All right then. Let's give it a shot.
Let's see if we can fake it.

252
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,458
What? Did you forget how to hug?

253
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,875
[♪ romantic music playing]

254
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,000
I remember how
to hug you very well, Güneş.

255
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,875
How should we do it? You tell me.

256
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,417
Like this? Huh?

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,208
[no audible dialogue]

258
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,292
[music continues]

259
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,292
Okay, fine. Okay.

260
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,833
There. See?

261
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,417
It's not the same
after you break up, right?

262
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,333
It was a mistake to ask you for help.

263
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,458
Deniz.

264
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,958
Yes?

265
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,000
[footsteps approaching]

266
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,208
[music ends]

267
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
He's playing with me.

268
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,875
I'll show you how this game is played.

269
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,375
Darling, it's no game.
He's madly in love with you.

270
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,458
Don't you get it?

271
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,750
Oh, he's already dumped the girl.
What else do you want?

272
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,042
[clicks tongue] Yes.

273
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,333
How do you know he broke up with her?

274
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,583
Did we receive intel on that, Özgen?

275
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,458
Because I just heard about that from Ege.

276
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,667
Wait a minute! Hold on.

277
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,958
You're still in touch
with Deniz's buddy Hakan.

278
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,208
[Beren] Give us a break, Güneş.

279
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:54,792
What dealings could we ever have
with his lousy buddy Hakan?

280
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,667
You wait. Just wait.

281
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,542
You know me.
I wouldn't turn a head for him.

282
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,583
Özgen? Tell me.

283
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,750
[inhales sharply]

284
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,750
We missed one detail.

285
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,292
Over there. You two hugged over there,
but you didn't kiss.

286
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,625
-Is that it?
-Don't change the subject. Tell me.

287
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,708
[gasps]

288
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,208
Oh, okay.

289
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,750
[scoffs] I'm a terrible liar anyway.

290
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,750
Wait. I mean,
why do we have to stop seeing Hakan

291
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,708
just because you broke up with Deniz?

292
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,792
I don't understand.
Is that what you're implying?

293
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,167
Wow. Fine then.

294
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,958
When you say "we,"
do you mean we're friends with Hakan?

295
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,375
Friend…

296
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,042
-Let's not call it friends. Fine.
-Hmm.

297
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,292
[Özgen] Um…

298
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,833
We're affiliated at a professional level
with Hakan.

299
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:41,333
-You meant "you" are affiliated.
-Yes, Beren. Fine. I am affiliated.

300
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,792
What is the nature of this affiliation?

301
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,542
Care to tell us, Özgen?

302
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,583
Huh?

303
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,292
[sighs]

304
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,917
Let's say we help each other out
on certain issues.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,125
[partner moaning, panting]

306
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,167
[sighs]

307
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,625
-[Hakan breathing heavily] Oh.
-[chuckles]

308
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,583
-[Hakan sighs]
-[chuckles]

309
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,125
[door unlocks]

310
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,708
-[door opens]
-[Özgen] Hello.

311
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,750
Honey?

312
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,542
Gee!

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,708
You ordered fast food without me?

314
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,792
What a bastard. And there's nothing left.

315
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,542
I can't believe it.

316
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,875
Hakan? Darling?

317
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,625
Hakan?

318
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,458
Hakan? [gasps]

319
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,708
Hakan, what the hell? Who is she?

320
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:48,792
I can explain.

321
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,417
What is there to explain? Tell me.

322
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,833
Is your name Hakan?

323
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,625
-Jerk.
-Ouch!

324
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,958
Tell me, Hakan. Speak up, asshole.

325
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,750
[chuckles]

326
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,958
[chuckles] Take them out to
a fancy restaurant, for heaven's sake.

327
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,542
I don't know, cook something nice.

328
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,250
I don't get it at all.

329
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,292
How can they buy into a fast food date?

330
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,583
It beats me.

331
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,875
Why do you have to yell,
calling me an asshole?

332
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,292
What's wrong with you?
I got slapped for it.

333
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,042
That surely hurt. I lost it there briefly.
I don't know.

334
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,667
I got carried away with the role.
I know the ropes now. That's why.

335
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,333
-But I was amazing. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

336
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,167
I asked you to come after I texted you.

337
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,250
You were early.

338
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,417
Really?

339
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, it seems you were early too.

340
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,667
No. It was just fine.

341
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,417
Really? Fine.

342
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,292
[laughs] You men get hyped up so easily.

343
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,542
Fine. Don't get upset.

344
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,083
I was running late,
so I thought I'd drop by.

345
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,833
Come on. So where is
my signed romance novel?

346
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,208
Um, I couldn't find it on my last trip.

347
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,917
Geez, Hakan!

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,083
Hakan, listen up! If you blow the deal,
I'll never come again.

349
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,208
I'll never save your ass.

350
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:59,042
Then you'll have to spend the whole day
with those chicks like in romance novels.

351
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,333
No. I… No worries.
I'm going to London next week,

352
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,250
and I'm sure I'll find it there.
I've got this.

353
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,625
Send me a list
if there is anything else you want.

354
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,875
I'll forget if you tell me now.

355
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,000
-A list?
-Yeah.

356
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,250
Okay, I will.

357
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,333
I'll let you off this time.

358
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,792
You made me sit on this dirty bed.

359
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,958
Ugh. Change the sheets.

360
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,958
Now I'm really curious.
I won't be able to sleep.

361
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
What did you tell this girl your name was?

362
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,000
[laughing]

363
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,083
Tell me. Tell me.

364
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,750
-I'm not telling you. I won't.
-[laughs]

365
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,875
Well, that's it.

366
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,583
[scoffs] I'm all flushed now.

367
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,417
I mean, we talk occasionally.

368
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,542
Sometimes he calls me for things.

369
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,875
You know.

370
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,458
What kind of things?

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,625
[Beren] Oh, she freaks me out sometimes.

372
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,458
It's a very gross friendship at that.
[exclaims]

373
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,667
This… The fact that you detest everything.

374
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,750
Have you guys ever heard the term
"friends with benefits"?

375
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,292
-[Güneş laughs]
-[Beren sighs]

376
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,208
Friends with benefits
is nothing like that, honey.

377
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,667
-No, it's not.
-[laughs]

378
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,625
Yeah. You know everything.

379
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,042
Wait. Stop right there.

380
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,458
Forget everything.

381
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,125
-And I mean everything.
-Hmm.

382
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,458
You're a rational woman.

383
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,292
How can you do this to another woman?

384
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,750
Sweetie, let's not waste time on that.
For one thing,

385
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,625
nothing about me is rational. [laughs]

386
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,208
-Indeed.
-Well, excuse me.

387
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:21,917
Um. Secondly, I'm sorry, but it's obvious
that Hakan is not marriage material.

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,167
I can see it in his eyes.
Women should also be able to get it.

389
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,958
Well, she's finally making sense.

390
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,083
I mean, women can't be fooled so easily.

391
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,125
-Sure.
-[Özgen] Well, boo-hoo.

392
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,083
What did Deniz's girlfriend Umay do?
She had her claws deep into him.

393
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,208
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

394
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,708
[sniffs]

395
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,583
So her name is Umay?

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,625
So you also talk about this stuff
with Hakan?

397
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,708
[sighs]

398
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,792
Dear, I…

399
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,250
I should go. [sighs]

400
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,250
See you, girls.

401
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,167
Okay, Güneş.

402
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,625
-Can't you shut up for once?
-I goofed up.

403
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,708
-Shit.

00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,917
Ege, are we done here yet?

407
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,083
Wait. Let me try out
that new slide over there.

408
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,792
Okay, make it quick.
I need to get back to work, okay?

409
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,458
Okay, I'll get back right away.

410
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay, toddlers. Off the floor!

411
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,375
[Deniz] First date.

412
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,583
The guy is very tense.
He can't stop talking.

413
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,958
The girl actually likes the guy,
but she's holding back.

414
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,333
Playing hard to get.

415
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,750
The poor guy feels like he has to talk to
avoid awkward silences. Blah, blah, blah.

416
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,542
He's sweating, but…

417
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,917
Now, look at him carefully.

418
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,000
He's worried that he's talking too much
on their first date.

419
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,292
You know, it's not cool.

420
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,292
-That's how it is.
-Hmm?

421
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,375
[Deniz] Uh-huh.

422
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,000
-[chuckles] Right.
-What?

423
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,875
[chuckles] Actually, they've been together
for a while now. Really.

424
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,333
In fact, the girl bought
that sweater he's wearing.

425
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,542
She has taste.

426
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,625
I bet she can even
bake birthday cakes for him.

427
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,958
And the guy is this type.
So, when the girl comes home from work…

428
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:25,708
-Uh-huh.
-…he asks, "How was your day, darling?"

429
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,042
-The guy? [clicks tongue]
-Hmm.

430
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,500
-He is.
-No way.

431
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,083

They've been married for forty years.

Pops enjoys a drink on the balcony
of their summer house.

She likes serving fruit and appetizers.

Her favorite thing is
to dunk bread in her appetizers

-Yes.

Oh, come on.

455
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,875
They met recently.

456
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,833
They occasionally meet at that park bench.

00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:34,000
-They both speak of their past…
-Hmm.

…and share their solitude
like the simit halves in their hands.

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,708
Do they also write poetry?

460
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,833
They do. They may be
writing a poetry book, all right?

461
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,292
Oh, for God's sake.

462

Really. They meet here now and then.

They spend a few hours together.

464
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,125
Then they both go back to their homes.

465
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,833

She has taste. An eye for detail.

00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,125
She cares about the guy.

486
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,875
She's the possessive type.

487
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,625
[chuckles] To the extent that
she often controls the relationship.

488
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,708
-But because the guy is so dominant…
-Yes?

489
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,292
-…she does it subtly.
-Oh, really?

490
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,958
So much so that the guy thinks
he's in control of things. [chuckles]

Well, yes. In brief.

503

You give all that detail
about total strangers.

a sentence about me? Shame on you.

-What? The guy is in love.
-Really…

-He's in love. That's it.
-In love. That's all?

Uh-huh. Nothing else.

-Nothing?
-He's just blinded by love.

I get it. Nothing more?

Why?

521
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,625
Because your post branded me as Mr. Alpha?

522
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:08,917
You saw it, right?

523
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,417
I did.

524
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,250
What you did…

525
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,833
How to put it?

526
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,750
You're right to be angry.

527
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:25,375
This is the biggest step you've taken
in our relationship so far, Güneş.

528
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,625
What? Aren't you angry?

529
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,708
On the contrary, you made me very happy.

530
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,417
This is the first time
you have done something for me,

531
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,667
maybe for both of us.

532
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,250
-What?
-Listen.

533
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,917
You know what?
I don't care how others see it.

534
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,250
When I look at that photo,

535
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,667
I see the two of us.

536
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,792
-[chuckles] I don't know what to say.
-[chuckles]

537
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,542
I'm a little relieved,
but I still feel embarrassed.

538
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,500
No. You shouldn't. You're an influencer.

539
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,792
Of course, you will post about Mr. Alpha.

540
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,875
That's expected.

541
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,625
I would never want to see you
in a predicament, Güneş.

542
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,542
Remember that.

543
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,625
Thank you for being so understanding.

544
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,917
Not at all.

545
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,833
Um, I left you in a difficult situation
by asking you to wear that ring.

546
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,292
[chuckles, inhales sharply]

547
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:30,333
Now, at least, I know
how you felt back then to some degree.

548
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,375
Let's call it even. [chuckles]

549
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,917
Besides, when I saw the post…

550
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:42,458
I thought to myself,
"There is still hope for us."

551
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,083
We have a photo together.
That's something, right?

552
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,750
Boran, I guess I'm not the person you
expected me to be in this relationship.

553
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,750
Don't be.

554
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,333
Don't.

555
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,417
Be who you want to be.

556
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,958
As long as you're with me, Güneş.

557
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,458
Thank you.

558
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,292
[Güneş sighs]

559
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:25,167
It's been ages since
anyone has been so kind…

560
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,167
and understanding towards me.

561
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,083
Thank you.

562
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,417
[phone buzzes]

563
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,625
REMINDER
PODCAST LIVE AIRING

564
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,083
I should be going soon.
I have to make it to the podcast.

565
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,833
Would you like me to give you a lift?

566
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,958
[door unlocks, opens]

567
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,500
Honey?

568
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,667
I'm home.

569
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,917
Hakan?

570
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,458
Darling?

571
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,042
Oh, I wonder where he is?

572
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:08,708
Sweetie, can't you hear me?

573
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,375
Huh?

574
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,375
Honey?

575
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,625
Not here either.

576
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,792
Where could he be?

577
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,833
Is he here? [gasps]

578
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:23,583
Oh! Hakan, who is this girl?

579
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,958
Damn. I'm so shocked.

580
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:30,167
What are you doing?
How could you do this to me?

581
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,250
Who are you?

582
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:35,042
[exclaims] Who are you,
lying in my boyfriend's bed?

583
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,542
How will you explain this to me? Explain.

584
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,000
-I can explain.
-Go on, then.

585
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,250
You saw what you saw.

586
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,833
Hakan and I love each other.

587
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,583
Don't get in our way!

588
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,625
What?

589
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,833
Hold on a minute. I mean, we just met.

590
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:52,000
Isn't it a little too soon?

591
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,542
No, it's not.

592
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:57,250
Right… Now, you… I'm flipping out here.
I'll pull your hair out.

593
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,750
-I swear I'll do it.
-In your dreams.

594
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,792
-Who do you think you are?
-Uh-oh!

595
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:02,917
-Get lost.
-Uh-oh, girl.

596
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,958
I'll kick the crap out of you. Leave now.

597
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,292
-Who the fuck do you think you are?
-Fuck off!

598
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,792
-[glass shatters]
-[partner screams]

599
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:10,792
Psycho!

600
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,708
-[laughs] Oh, fuck.
-[door opens]

601
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,375
-Dude, what a nutter.
-[door closes]

602
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,917
Listen. Was that too harsh?
Telling her to fuck off and all? Huh?

603
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,333
-Özgen?
-What?

604
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,833
I swear, you are the only person
who could have pulled that off.

605
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,208
[laughs] Right.

606
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,042
I adore you, crazy bitch.

607
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,458
[chuckles] Keep your pants on! [scoffs]

608
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:33,458
I can't believe I'm fighting for
a man the same age as me.

609
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,375
[both chuckle]

610
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,250
What's that on your face?

611
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,167
What is it?

612
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,542
Let's go out for a nice meal.

613
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:46,542
I'll get dressed if you give me
some privacy. Let's have a bite to eat.

614
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,708
Oh, yeah. You're still naked.

615
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:54,083
I have things to do anyway.
[clears throat]

616
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,333
Um, I'll be off.

617
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,917
Tidy up a little while you're at it.

618
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,125
See you later.

619
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,875
What about food?

620
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:04,958
No.

621
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,042
[Deniz sighs]

622
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:12,042
Can you try calling this number again?
Tell his family that he's here.

623
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,125
Yes, sir.

624
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,875
You work too much, Deniz.

625
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,292
Oh, really?

626
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:21,083
-You're missing so much.
-Don't rub it in my face.

627
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,583
Be a good boy and wait here.

628
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,042
Mr. Rauf, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Something came up.

629
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,917
-Welcome.
-[Ege] Will you offer me something?

630
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,708
Strawberry milk, maybe?

631
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,583
Get used to it, Deniz.

632
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,292
Get some practice.

633
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,292
We're not hardwired to be fathers,

634
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,167
and what we do here is
a piece of cake compared to fatherhood.

635
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,333
Um…

636
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,750
-It's still too early for that. [chuckles]
-[laughs]

637
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,125
[Rauf] I've heard that before, Deniz.

638
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,750
You get tricked into it,

639
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:52,500
and the next thing you know,
you're changing diapers. [chuckles]

640
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,042
-I see you patched things up with Güneş.
-Huh?

641
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,625
I saw Güneş's post.

642
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,542
Um…

643
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,083
Güneş likes posting.

644
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,208
I saw you together at that event
where you made a speech.

645
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:11,083
Uh-huh. [clears throat]

646
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,000
Now, I have no problem with this,

647
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,000
but it's no secret
what people think of influencers.

648
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:22,125
I don't know how an influencer architect
will go down at our company.

649
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,208
[phone ringing]

650
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,292
Calling…

651
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,500
Yes. Shall we begin?

652
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,417
-[colleague speaking indistinctly]
-[phone buzzes]

653
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,375
Notification
New message - Pervin

654
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,375
[Pervin] Will we hear your voice

655
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:44,417
when Güneş talks about
Mr. Alpha on the podcast?

656
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,542
Um, Mr. Rauf. Please may I be excused?

657
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:50,375
-Hakan, can you cover for me?
-What's the matter? Not bad news, I hope.

658
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,875
No, no. It's not.

659
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:52,958
[clears throat]

660
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,375
Maybe at the beginning of a relationship…

661
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,542
[phone buzzing]

662
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,750
Calling…

663
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,417
Um. Maybe we will direct…

664
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,042
I'm here at the studio. Don't worry.
I'll be going on air soon.

665
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,458
Oh, great.

666
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,708
They'll broadcast it tomorrow.
You will be on the road.

667
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,208
I'll listen to it. I'll let you know
if any revisions are needed, dear.

668
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:24,167
-Okay?
-All right. Thank you.

669
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,375
[Pervin] Talk plenty about love, dear.

670
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:30,542
-Mr. Alpha and plenty of love.
-[bird] Love, love.

671
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,583
-All right.
-[laughs] Sweetie pie.

672
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,542
Listen to me.

673
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,167
Deniz didn't answer.
You're together, right?

674
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,625
[stammers] We…
We were together just this morning.

675
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,458
What does he think about
showing his face in Cappadocia?

676
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,667
-What does that mean?
-Oh, did I ruin the surprise?

677
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,583
Listen. Don't say a word.
You didn't hear it from me.

678
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,000
Keep it between us.
I won't talk to you otherwise. Okay?

679
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,542
I just texted him.

680
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:59,625
I asked if he would
say a few words on air.

681
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,250
Huh? What do you think?

682
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,833
-[sighs]
-Sensational, right?

683
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,292
Oh, Güneş, please.

684
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:08,500
He has this deep voice.
So beautiful. So sexy.

685
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,125
Oh, the way he talks. We must hear him.

686
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,333
Talk to him.
I'm sure you'll convince him. Huh?

687
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,083
Pervin, I really have to go.

688
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,250
Someone will meet you
at the airport tomorrow.

689
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,542
-[sighs]
-And I have little surprises for you.

690
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,167
You'll see when you get there. Okay?

691
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,667
Okay. Thanks.

692
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,083
Bye.

[phone buzzes]

694
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,583
I'm at the car park.

[Deniz sighs]

698
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,000
Will you ever come to your senses?

699
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,958
Stop criticizing me!

700
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,417
Enough.

701
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I didn't ask you to come here.

702
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,833
It was Pervin's idea to reveal your face
and broadcast your voice.

703
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,875
-I'm tired of these games.
-So back off!

704
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,542
I just had to lie my way out of
an important meeting because of you.

705
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,917
[sighs] Oh, sorry. Mr. Alpha never lies.

706
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,042
Mr. this, Alpha that! Dang!

707
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,042
My life is guided by trust, damn it.

708
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,250
My rivals are just waiting for me
to slip up. Do you have any idea?

709
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,500
What? And this is my job.

710
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,042
It's my job to post
and be a guest speaker on this podcast.

711
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,667
Show some respect.

712
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,875
Respect? Sorry, but you posted
a photo as if we had made up.

713
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,125
Everyone is congratulating me.

714
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,792
God, give me patience!
What else should I expect?

715
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,833
Not everything is about you, okay?

716
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:26,750
-The world doesn't revolve around you.
-How is it not about me?

717
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,792
I doubt you even thought of me
before hitting send.

718
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:32,500
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't think of you
while I desperately sought a solution.

719
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,375
I'm sorry. If you calm down and listen,
I'll explain.

720
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,292
Go on, tell me. I'm dying to know.

721
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,917
Go on. For heaven's sake, tell me.

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,042
I need to sell the house
because I need the money.

723
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,625
I don't get this money thing at all.

724
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,833
Don't you earn a living
by being an influencer?

725
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:48,792
So you don't earn enough from publicity
and collabs as it is?

726
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,292
What's the point in trampling over
my career, my reputation, my trust?

727
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:55,833
Your career? Trust?
Are you lecturing me on trust?

728
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:58,458
I can't count on you
to come to Cappadocia with me.

729
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,333
That's why I had to post a photo
with another man in the first place.

730
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:04,042
-How can you talk about trust, huh?
-Are you really going to stand here

731
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,042
and tell me about the virtues of
being an influencer, huh?

732
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,833
Isn't that what destroyed
our relationship, Güneş?

733
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,417
[sighs] No, it's not, Deniz.

734
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,250
We broke up because you insisted on
using this as an excuse.

735
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,458
That's a lie.

736
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,917
We broke up because you couldn't
keep your promise to me, Güneş.

737
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,042
I… [sighs]

738
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,417
You went and promoted my rival
and made me an accessory.

739
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
Do you know that our photo is still
on display at that construction site?

740
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,208
How many times are we going
to talk about this? How many times?

741
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,792
I'm telling you, I didn't know.

742
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,708
I didn't know they were going
to use it like that, okay?

743
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,208
Fuck my career.
You wanted to be an influencer.

744
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:38,042
I told you explicitly that I didn't want
to show my face, not to involve me.

745
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,000
You chose your career over me.

746
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,833
And here you are, still at it.

747
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,208
I had to, Deniz.

748
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,250
I was abandoned.

749
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,208
I was alone.

750
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,333
Just like this Cappadocia thing.

751
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,750
Can we get this straight once and for all?

752
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,583
We weren't together because of this job.

753
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,417
We were together,
and you brought your job into it.

754
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,458
You think I like doing this? Huh?

755
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm trying to find a solution.
I have to sell that house.

756
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,458
I need the money.

757
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:13,750
Do you think I'm comfortable selling
a stranger's house?

758
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,833
You think it's easy?

759
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,083
For God's sake!

760
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,417
Tell me how much you need,
and I'll give it to you.

761
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,375
Let's put an end to this ordeal.

00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,458
-[sighs]
-What?

763
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,292
Go spend your money on someone else.

764
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,833
All I needed was you waving your money
and thinking it would solve my problems.

765
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,833
Now I've seen it all. Thanks a lot.

766
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,083
That's not what I'm trying to do.
I'm just offering a solution.

767
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,458
Not every problem is solved with
status or money, Deniz.

768
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,750
Yes, I need money.

769
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,792
Yes. I have to pay for
my sister's tuition fee.

770
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,500
So, I'm not earning that much.

771
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,792
Happy now?

772
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,083

Forget everything. Tell me…

774
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:58,292
How are we going to fake a relationship
and make it work? Is that even possible?

775
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,542
Right.

776
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,917
We can't be like that either, Deniz.

778
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,458
Exactly. I won't get involved in anything
I don't believe in.

00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,708

her romance articles and as an influencer.

No fighting.

788
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,500
I need to ask you something.

789
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,792
That's why I'm here.

790
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,042
Go ahead, buddy.

791
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,542
They didn't answer
when you called them, right?

792
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,417
They had no clue I was even missing.

863
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,417
Deniz, I'm here.

864
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,667
I'm not giving up on you.

865
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,750
I'm not going anywhere.

866
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,292
I want to be with you.
Do you feel the same way?

867
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:11,875
Fine. [sighs]

868
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,792
Well, since you asked.

869
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,500
You deserve an honest answer.
Let's put things straight.

870
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,000
I thought about it too.

871
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,750
You were right.

872
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,792
I'm still healing from the wounds
left by Güneş.

873
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,458
Nevertheless, I'm on my feet.
I've gotten used to living with it.

874
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,958
We're not together, just so you know.

875
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,208
I didn't approach her,
and neither did she.

876
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,292
She recently posted a photo.
I'm not in it.

877
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,083
So you saw the post too.

878
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,500
You know about the Mr. Alpha post.

879
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,375
I know, but let me be clear.

880
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:49,500
You're accusing me of something
I haven't done for the second time.

881
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,542
I don't owe an explanation
to anyone, Umay.

882
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,042
Where are you going?

883
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,750
To the restroom. Is that okay?

884
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,375
Sure.

885
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,583
[Güneş sighs]

886
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:06,958
Hello.

887
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,333
May I have an espresso, please?

888
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,792

889
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,417
Güneş podcast is streaming,
you can listen to it.

We Sat At This Table
Güneş Güner

891
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,292
[host] My guest today
is the famous editor Güneş Güner.

892
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,750
More recently, we know her from
her romance articles and as an influencer.

893
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,542
-[Güneş] Hello.
-[host] Hello.

894
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,958
Can we cut to the chase
and talk about Mr. Alpha?

895
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:49,125
[chuckles]

896
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,458
We can talk about him

897
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:54,958
but don't expect to find out
more than is revealed in the photos.

898
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,042
Wait a minute. Hold on.

899
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,542
So how long will this mystery last?

900
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,792
I don't know.

901
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,167
[chuckles] I hope it lasts forever.

902
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,250
[host] Even sharing your ring
is enough to make you feel jealous.

903
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,167
It seems you really want to
keep him only to yourself.

904
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,625
I don't know how to respond to that.

905
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,417
-[bartender] Can I get you anything else?
-No, I don't. I don't want anything.

906
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:32,042
[host] Is your relationship similar
to the ones you portray in your articles?

907
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,125
Or is the influencer in you
fine-tuning the whole thing?

908
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:38,708
Honestly, I don't know if I count
as an influencer. I don't know.

909
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:41,667
I mean, I've recently received
collaboration offers,

910
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,250
but I don't see myself
as one at the moment.

911
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,625
-Where did the lady go?
-She left.

912
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,875
[Güneş] I think the chemistry of love
is different for everyone.

913
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,250
Love evolves into something else
as those molecules

914
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:17,292
blend through experiences
with our partners.

915
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:21,667
[host] Okay. You talk about
molecules, but how do you define love?

916
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,625
Define love?

917
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,208
It can be as serious as a history book.

918
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:35,333
I think it is also as fun as a playground.

919
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,417
There is this ride.

920
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,250
It's like stepping on a platform.
It spins around, making you dizzy.

921
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,750
I don't remember its name right now.

922
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:52,125
-[host] The merry-go-round.
-[Güneş] Yes, merry-go-round.

923
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,375
The merry-go-round.

[music continues]

926
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:21,375
I guess love feels like
a playground to me.

927
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,375
Maybe because I first fell in love there.

928
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,583
[music ends]

929
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,083
[host]
I don't want to discredit your idea,

930
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,375
but a merry-go-round
makes you sick after a while.

931
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:43,458
Like doomed relationships,
the ones that drag on.

932
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:47,625
-Men are like that sometimes, aren't they?
-[laughs] Yes.

933
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:48,833
But you're spot on. Yes.

934
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,667
That's when trust
in a relationship matters.

935
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,333
That's the seesaw.

936
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:59,417
One side is always higher
in relationships,

937
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,000
while the other is lower.

938
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,542
This balance changes constantly.

939
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:07,292
On that seesaw,

940
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,542
you have to feel sure that your partner
won't make you fall flat on your face.

He went to the restroom.

Sure.

953
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,458
Ms. Güneş,
why don't you proceed to the plane?

954
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,875
I'll take care of your friend

so Cookie can sit here?

See what we have to go through.

[Güneş] At the playground, you keep asking
yourself the same question.

Should I stay, or should I leave?

Try to decide all you want.

988
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:28,208
It will never be a decision
based on reason.

989
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:34,000
Because you are at the playground,
and the game of love will always find you.

990
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,750
It will make you do things
you thought you'd never do,

991

turn your life upside down,

992
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:44,583
and make you forget breathing
and yourself.

993
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,000
It will sweep you off your feet.

at that very moment.
