Do you remember what love was like?

16
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,583
There were ways of living it.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,875
There was the thrill of discovering it.

18
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:02,792
Love was like getting lost
in a foreign language.

19
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,917
It was knowing that the real gem
was hidden in the moment.

20
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,083
It was discovering him in the details.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,625
Love was the inability
to describe a feeling.

22
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,542
At times,
love was a miracle you had to fight for.

23
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:28,500
Ultimately, it was a duel that could only
be won by those who lived that miracle.

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,000
It was opening your heart to hear
the most beautiful melody in the world.

25
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,792
It was fitting life into a smile.

26
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,375
Love was to see with your heart.

27
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,917
You used to embrace life as it came.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,042
As if nothing were a miracle.

29
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:52,458
Then, love would appear
to make life the miracle it truly is.

30
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:56,667
[chuckles] Are you actually
quoting my own article back to me?

31
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,125
Listen, Güneş.

32
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:03,167
[chuckles] 157,000 people
have shared your article.

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,583
I get it. You're trying
to talk me out of it.

34
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,083
Oh, no. The thing is,

35
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:12,167
I can't believe the author is on her way
to break up with him right now.

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,292
I've made up my mind, Beren.

37
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,667
It's not working out. You know that, too.

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,833
I don't know.
I guess I feel it's partly my fault.

39
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:23,125
Now, it seems like I made you think twice
about this guy by saying

40
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,333
that things seemed different with Deniz.

41
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,250
Uh-uh. What are you talking about?

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,208
I decided to break up with Boran.
It has nothing to do with you, okay?

43
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,333
Well, what about Mr. Alpha?

44
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,250
Could it have something to do with Deniz?

45
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,042
You hesitated.

46
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,625
Come on, admit it.
You still have a thing for Deniz.

47
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,583
Fine, I do.

48
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,917
Every time I pick up my phone,
I see people asking about Mr. Alpha.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,000
You can't say you broke up, right?

51
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,875
It's insane, isn't it?

52
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,958
Being an influencer and having your life
so bridled by your love affair, right?

53
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,250
So weird.

54
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,750
[Güneş] Actually,
I was just your typical magazine editor.

55
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,750
But Deniz used to loathe Instagram.

56
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,458
You know, the whole influencer thing,
having followers.

57
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:12,417
He said I could do whatever I wanted
as long as I kept him out of it.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,792
So, on one of our vacations,
I posted a photo of us hugging,

59
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,375
showing only his shoulders and back.

60
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,583
And instead of using his name,
I tagged him as Mr. Alpha.

61
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,833
My first vacation with Mr. Alpha.

62
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,875
My third date with Mr. Alpha.

63
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,250
The more I shared these intimate moments,

64
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,833
the more curious my followers became
about who Deniz was.

65
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,542
We broke up six months ago.
It was complicated.

66
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,708
I stopped posting.

67
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:41,125
I ended it, so don't get carried away
when I say complicated.

68
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,917
Anyway, I met Boran a few months ago.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,792
[sighs] Now, it's time
for a breakup conversation with him.

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,542
I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,792
What did you say?

72
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,250
I wanted to know who you are here for.

73
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,333
Boran.

74
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,500
Boran gave me this address.

75
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,583
Güneş.

76
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,625
Oh. He looks so happy! Wish me luck.

77
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,417
Boran.

78
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,333
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

79
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,042
You look amazing.

80
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,500
Thank you.

81
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,042
-How are you?
-Fine.

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,583
I hope to keep it that way.

83
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,625
Boran, why did we meet here?

84
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,208
Is this place yours as well?

85
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,458
[laughs] How did you guess?

86
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,375
We seem to have a habit
of meeting at places you own.

87
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,375
We used upcycled materials
in the construction.

88
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,292
So, we cut costs
and minimized our environmental impact.

89
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:43,375
By using natural stone and wood,
in addition to upcycled material,

90
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,500
we wanted to create
a sustainable structure.

91
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,875
And I believe we did
an excellent job with that.

I understand you have a nickname
for your mystery man gig, Deniz.

96
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,250
Or should I refer to you as Mr. Alpha?

97
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,708
[scoffs] Who did you hear that from?

98
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,875
It's you. I knew it as soon as I saw you.

99
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,375
The main question is,
why haven't I heard it from you, Deniz?

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,167
Since when am I supposed to keep you
updated on my past love affairs? Come on!

101
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,708
So, you were in love?

It's over, finished.
What are you getting at?

104
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,625
Deniz. You told me
that it ended six months ago.

105
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,167
-And?
-Look at this.

106
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
She posted it a few weeks ago.

107
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,958
So what? She posts whatever she wants.

108
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,083
-She writes--
-Oh. So, you know she writes.

109
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,875
In that case, there's no point in me
telling you about her article,

110
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,458

111
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,875
Can you calm down?
People are looking at us.

00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,000

for no reason here.

For no reason? Really?

Stop pissing me off, Deniz.

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,167
You're not even on social media.

117
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,208
Where did you see this post then?
Huh? Who?

118
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,083
Was it Hakan? Did he tell you
to reconsider your options?

119
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,083
What else did he say?
What did he tell you?

120
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,958
You are so touchy about everything.

121

Make sure you know the facts
before throwing a tantrum.

122

If I meant anything to you,
you would have told me, Deniz.

to understand. Thanks.

Well, I needed a word with you, too.

140
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,042
I just don't know
if this is the right place.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,917
I've been thinking for the past few weeks,

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,333

-Um, Güneş.
-Huh?

00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,417
I want our life to be filled
with celebrations as well.

Will you grow old with me?

150
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,292

Um, so? Don't you think
a surprise proposal is much better?

No. Um, it's-- It's not.

00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,708
All right. I'll take the ring.

175
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,375
But we need to discuss it
in detail later, okay?

176
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,417
Okay. But you will wear it, right?

177
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,375
Yes. Okay. Yes. [chuckles]

-[Boran] Yes! That's it.

00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,333
[Beren] How did it go?
Did you break up with him?

183
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,000
I think I kind of agreed to marry him.

184
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,292
What?

185
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,750
Well, I didn't say yes, but the ring…

186
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,750
The thing is I put the ring on,

187
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,833
so he wouldn't lose face
in front of his grandma.

188
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,833
Um, you put the ring on?

189
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:00,958
Yes.

190
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,333
But I must have a word with him
when I return the ring,

191
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,375
because right now
everything is a huge mess.

192
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,042
If only this event were over.

193
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,792
Or maybe it shouldn't be over.

194
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,042
I really need to get hammered.

195
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,292
What event? Whe… Where are you?

196
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,417
I'm at the "Cities of the Future" event.

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,833
Check out my collab post.

198
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,917

[gasps] Güneş, you're unbelievable.
You're still wearing the ring.

202
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,042
Yes, I am because this ring
won't come off, Beren.

203
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,833
I can't take it off. It's stuck.

204
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,125
Ugh!

205
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,750
I forgot about it and posted the pic.
I realized it later, but it was too late.

206
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,375
Is it that obvious?

207
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,875
Look. People are asking
if the ring is from Mr. Alpha.

Thank you. The gentleman can have it.

216

Absolutely not.

217

She is not just a good editor
but also a renowned influencer.

This gentleman is
the famous architect Deniz Derenoğlu.

220
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,875
He is delivering the opening speech today.

221
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,042
That slipped my mind
before coming to this event.

222

Where is your Mr. Alpha?

223
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,500
I don't know.

Where is he?

Even if he's here, we'll never know
who he is, right?

226

Hmm.

227
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,875
I was unaware of the schedule
and the speakers before coming here.

228
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,167
You don't need to leave
just because I'm here.

229
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,167
I shouldn't stop you from doing your job.

I'm totally cool with it.

What are you cool with?

238
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,583
I'm curious.

What are you cool about? Me being here?

240
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,417
Me being an influencer?

241
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,333
Remember, we broke up
because I'm an influencer, Deniz.

I'll get you both something stronger, sir.

some sense into you?

248

I told you on the phone, Deniz.

249
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,500
I had no idea that the ad was for
your rival company when I sent the post.

250
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,125
Hmm.

in Argah Residence, is that it?

253

They have the right to use
my posts for their projects.

254
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,125
It's my job. What can I do? It's work!

255
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,000
Do as you please, but why drag me into it?

256
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,625
You promised
you would never do that again.

257
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,292
I signed a contract stating
that the ad must feature Mr. Alpha.

258
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,958
I had to. I was obligated.
What else could I do?

I never thought it would
be such a big campaign.

00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:14,417
I tried to tell you as soon as
I found out, but you never listened.

264
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,542
You were never interested in my work.

265
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,167
I get it. You thought I wouldn't find out.

266
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,542
I saw it when I was stuck in traffic.

would be so big, Deniz.

I had already signed.

What don't you understand?

283

You can't even keep your promises to me,
and you expect us to plan a future.

284

What are you saying?
What does that even mean?

285
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,583
It means if you don't change,

286
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,708
a happy future like the one
in those photos is impossible.

287

-Yeah, sure.

I said I didn't want to be
in those photos anymore.

296

I told you many times.
I asked you not to use me.

just leave me out of it.

is ruined by your post?

00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,250
There was no reason to have one.

521
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,583
Aren't you going to tell me your name?

522
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,917
What do you need my name for?

523
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,292
What name do I save your number under?

524
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,000
Güneş, like the sun emoji.

525
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,375
By the way,
I'll be done here in an hour or two.

526
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,042
My meeting might finish early.

527
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,125
Great.

528
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:12,000
Meet me at the pier in three hours then.

529
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:15,625
-Don't miss the ferry.
-[chuckles]

530
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,542
Will you ever ask for my name?

531
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,958
[clicks tongue] I'll call you Alpha.

532
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,208

[sighs]

534
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,708
Okay, people. Our concept is diversity.

535
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,625
Diversity.

536
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,292
Sustainability.

537
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,792
Sustainability and diversity in fashion.

538
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:51,750
And most importantly,
how love connects to these concepts.

539
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,625
Love always sells.

540
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:58,583
It always has, and it always will.

You've got something in the pipeline,
right?

Oh, I have a feeling it's going
to be very, very good.

But don't forget, folks,

Here, these are for you, Mr. Erhan.
You can take a look if you want.

I can't believe I missed it. [sighs]

563
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:36,125
Are you disappointed that you missed
the ferry or me? Which one? Be honest.

564
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,958
All right. But you first.

565
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,667
How long have you been standing here,

566
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,250
watching people get on and off the ferries
to meet me?

567
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,458
I just got here.

568
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,125
It took a while
to find a lilac-colored helmet.

569
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,958
No sweat.
We weren't taking the ferry anyway.

570
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,250
Meaning?

571
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:08,625
If we weren't going to take the ferry,
why did I race all the way here?

572
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,500
I suppose you're not the romantic type.

573
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,583
No, I like romance.

574
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,333
I love it, but I can't stand traffic.

575
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,292
All right then, let's go.

576
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:18,917
This way.

577
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,958
Why do you take the ferry
when you have such a cool motorcycle?

578
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,667
Let's say it was a hunch.

579
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,292
Will you help me?

580
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,542
Sure.

00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,167

I'm here to see Deniz Derenoğlu.

Let me check to see if he's here.

00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,708
[receptionist] Is Mr. Deniz in his office?

588
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,708
There is Mr. Deniz.

589
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,250
Why aren't you answering your phone?

590
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,208
I was on the motorcycle.

591
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,167
You wouldn't come here for no reason.
Is something wrong?

592
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,583
I'm not fond of talking to you,

593
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,708
so I wouldn't be here
if it weren't important.

594
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,792
Oh.

595
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,875
I'll tell you if you're ready to listen.

596
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,292
Go ahead then.

597
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,000
The thing is…

598
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,458
Deniz, look at me, will you?

599
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,625
Stop acting like a child.

600
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,708
If you don't want to listen, just tell me,
and I'll leave.

601
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,375
I'm all ears, Güneş.

602
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm here to ask a favor.

603
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,583
By the way, a package was delivered to you
at your old address.

604
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,125
It's been over six months, Deniz.

605
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,000
Why haven't you updated it?

606
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,375
I have.

607
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:52,208
Not immediately,
but it's been a few months though.

608
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,542
Uh-huh.

609
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,208
To be honest, it was only a few weeks ago.

610
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,417
I thought so.

611
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,958
There must be a mistake.

612
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,375
I haven't ordered anything lately, though.

613
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,208
Didn't you feel the urge to sneak a peek?

614
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:08,792
Should I have?

615
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,958
No, I didn't.

616
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,500
I thought you might have ordered it
a while ago.

617
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,583
I didn't touch it.

618
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,000
Were you worried
it might bring back memories?

619
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,625
[Umay] Deniz.

620
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,833
Am I interrupting?

621
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,292
[Deniz] No. No.

622
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,083
You wanted to ask me something.

623
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,667
I'm interrupting.

624
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,500
I'll take care of it. No problem.

625
00:38:58,667 --> 00:38:59,667
All right.

626
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,708
[receptionist] This is for you.

627
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,167
When will she let us be, Deniz?

628
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,333
-She already has.
-Really?

629
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,708
Come on, Deniz.

630
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,625
I saw how she looked at the helmet.

631
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,667
I looked through Güneş's articles
while waiting for the coffee.

632
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,000
Hmm.

633
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,375
Here's the deal.

634
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:26,042
You might still think
about Güneş occasionally.

635
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,542
But I'm not having it.

636
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,333
Call me when she's out
of your life for good.

637
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,417
Okay?

638
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,167
Enjoy.

639
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Thanks.

your sister's tuition,

643
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,583
take a long vacation,
and experience true love.

644
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,125
What more could you wish for?

645
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,083
-But there's a catch.
-She refuses to listen.

646
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,125
We need to convince the lawyer
that Deniz and I are a couple.

647
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,083
Sure, go talk to Deniz.

648
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,792
He can pretend you two are still together
and convince the lawyer. So what?

649
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,167
Sure, but he also has to deal

650
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,875
-with his new unruly lover.
-Ugh!

651
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,542
-Don't talk like that, Özgen.
-What do you expect, honey?

652
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,208
I'll deal with it.

653
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,375
I'll find a way.
I'll go alone to talk to the lawyer.

654
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,250
I will also go to Cappadocia
to see the house.

655
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,875
Hold on…

656
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:32,833
Are you going to Cappadocia
to see the house, or is it just escapism?

657
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't understand.

658
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:38,250
I mean, I can't tell if it's an attempt
to avoid talking to Deniz

659
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,375
or to stop herself from opening that box.

660
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,458
Open the box already. See for yourself.

661
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,875
-Enough.
-[Özgen laughs]

662
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,708
Enough. [scoffs] I've had it up to here
with box metaphors.

663
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,917
-Okay. Fine.
-Pfft. Okay.

664
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:53,542
So, are you actually going to Cappadocia?

665
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,125
Of course, I am. What else should I do?
I can't afford the tuition fee right now.

666
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:58,917
Gosh.

667
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,917
I wonder what lies ahead for her
while she sits here making plans.

668
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,458
-Enough, Özgen.
-[laughs]

669
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,875
-Okay, sorry. Forgive me. I apologize.
-[Güneş] Enough already.

670
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,083
I can't help saying something, though.

671
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,583
Let's keep the box closed
so we can keep staring at it.

672
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,875
Güneş, for God's sake,
please open that box now.

673
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,583
-No, I won't.
-Why don't you?

674
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,917
I won't.

675
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
I see. All right.

676
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:28,208
Opening the box will cause Güneş
to confront the past.

677
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,625
-I'm sure that's the reason.
-No.

678
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,625
It has nothing to do with that.
What are you suggesting?

679
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,875
If so, then why aren't we opening it?
Let's just do it.

680
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,958
Because it's not mine.

681
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,625
Pfft. Jesus.

682
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:38,375
Deniz belongs to someone else now.

683
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,083
-You're being ridiculous.
-[chuckles] What?

684
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,083
Don't be ridiculous, seriously.
Stop bothering me.

685
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,250
For one thing,
there's still a connection between them.

686
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,958
Never mind her, girl.
Can you give me a recap?

687
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,708
I'm interested in the close contact
and intimacy. I want to hear it all again.

688
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,542
I never talked about intimacy.

689
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,792
Well. But--

690
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:55,167
Honey,
that's exactly what you've been implying.

691
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,375
You've been staring at the box,
talking about your love affair.

692
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,000
Tell me I'm wrong.

693
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,833
[Özgen]
And I'll repeat myself if necessary.

694
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,917
Your paths keep crossing
professionally and personally.

695
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,583
It's like a movie.

696
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:09,167
All you say is love! Where is love?

697
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,042
Show me. There is no love. It's over.

698
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,917
In fact, everything to do
with Deniz is over.

699
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,375
No doubt. I am sure about that.
Whatever you say.

700
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:22,375
Yeah, sure, but what about
the elephant in the room, Güneş?

701
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,125
Huh?

702
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,625
Honey, let's open the box.
Please, I'm begging you.

703
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,875
My heart is pounding.
I can't take it anymore.

704
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,292
I'm not touching it.

705
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:39,083
-Look, she's losing it.
-You're so stubborn.

706
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm losing my mind.

707
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,750
[chuckles]

708
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,000
[sighs]

709
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,333
[Deniz] Ege.

710
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,000
Are they at it again?

711
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,208
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

712
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:00,292
I'm going to have a word with your father.
This is not on.

713
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:05,125
You could try,
but there's no point when he's drunk.

714
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,375
[sighs]

715
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,125
Were you out there all night?

716
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,333
What a relief.

717
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:21,042
I could barely hear my thoughts.

718
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,875
What were you thinking of?

719
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:28,625
I was trying to decide whether I should
show you Güneş's last post.

720
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,083
Go on, show me.

721
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,500
It seems she has moved on.
There may be someone new.

722
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,333
No, that photo is from an event.

723
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,167
You drink too much as well.

724
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,917
You haven't recovered from Güneş.

725
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,958
You look for happiness in others.

726
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,250
Stop it.

727
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,542
This is no way to live.

728
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,167
Kiddo, you're just seven years old.
What do you know about life?

729
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,500
[sighs] Oh.

730
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,208
Umay and I had another argument.

731
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:56,875
I think it's over this time.

732
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,625
It's for the best, bro.

733
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,750
You drink too much of this stuff.
Pull yourself together already.

734
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,833
Here.

735
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:06,333
I have one pleasure in life.

736
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:07,792
-Leave me alone.
-[scoffs]

737
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,750
Cheers.

738
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,083
[sighs]

739
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,333
-I saw Güneş.
-Where?

740
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,167
Where did you see her?
Did she ask about me?

741
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,875
We talked briefly.

742
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,792
What did she say? Has she missed me?

743
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,125
We couldn't talk much.

744
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:36,542
Why? What did you do again?

745
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:41,125
Stop wasting her time,
or I won't be your friend anymore.

746
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,542
I take it you didn't
get much sleep last night.

747
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,792
Isn't it time for you to rest?
Go lay down over there.

748
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,250
Isn't it time you woke up, Deniz?

749
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,542
Ege, kid.

750
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,458
Go lie down now, or I'll put you
back on the doorstep where I found you.

751
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,417
I'm just looking out for you.

752
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,917
Umay isn't your type, Deniz.

753
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,833
You're about to lose Güneş for good.

754
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,083
You're still young.

755
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,667
I'm sure you'll understand me better
as you grow older.

756
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,167
If you understood how you were with Güneş,
you would know what I mean.

757
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,125
My parents have worn me out.

758
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,667
I can't handle an argument
with you right now.

759
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,083
Okay, I hear you. Go on then,
get some rest. Quick.

760
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,958
[sighs, huffs] Fine.

761
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:22,500
I'm going to rest my eyes.

762
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:28,333
If they come, please don't carry me
next door to my bed like a baby, okay?

763
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:30,000
I won't forgive you.

764
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:31,792
Seriously? What's wrong with that?

765
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,542
I said I don't want to argue.

766
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,167
Fine. Get some rest now.

767
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,542
[sighs]

768
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:47,792
She was wearing a pink dress,
just like on our first date.

769
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,333
[sighs]

770
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,042
[sighs] Mmm.

771
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:59,375
But I didn't have much to say.

772
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,458
[Güneş] The woman told me everything.

773
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,875
She even described you.

774
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:08,042
Actually, she warned me about
the problems we might run into.

775
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,375
2 YEARS AGO

776
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,042
Visiting a fortune teller
on our first date

777
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,792
is something that never occurred to me.

778
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,833
She's a psychic, not a fortune teller.

779
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,708
Fine.

780
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,417
Do you really believe
those psychics and fortune tellers?

781
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Hmm.

782
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,833
I believe in us.

783
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,333
So, right now,
I prefer to savor my margarita

784
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,458
and pretend I didn't hear what she said.

785
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:42,708
Come on. What exactly did she say?

786
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,583
I'm curious. Please tell me.

787
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:45,917
I'll tell you when the time comes.

788
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,750
You won't find out until then.

789
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:48,917
Oh, really?

790
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,708
What's going to happen then?

791
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:52,042
Huh?

792
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,208
We embark on a long journey.

793
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,167
One that will change our lives.

794
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,750
Deniz.

795
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,417
Deniz.

796
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,875
Deniz, do you hear me?

797
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,000
[grunts]

798
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,458
Güneş.

799
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,375
[grunts]

800
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,167
[knocks on door]

801
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:48,292
-Boran?
-Güneş, I'm sorry.

802
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:54,083
I've thought about it, and I realize
I put you in an awkward position.

803
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:56,125
I know. You're right.

804
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,292
So, these are for you.

805
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,500
Um. I wish you had called.

806
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,875
Uh… You're right.

807
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:08,417
I should have called,
but I wanted to talk in person.

808
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,917
I wanted to see you…
[chuckles] …to see your beautiful face.

809
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,750
Listen, Güneş.

810
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,708
-Wear the ring when you feel ready.
-[door closes]

811
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,125
Don't if you'd rather not.

812
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,750
Honestly.

813
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,333
Thanks.

814
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,792
You're welcome.

815
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,000
DENİZ DERENOĞLU
İSTANBUL

816
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,792
[Boran] I don't want to push you.

817
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,583
I just want you to be happy.

818
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,417
-You are okay, right?
-Uh-huh.

819
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:05,083
Um. I don't want these to wilt,
so I'll put them in water.

820
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,250
Is that all right?

821
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:08,750
I have something to tell you.

822
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:12,542
From now on, we'll do things your way,
okay?

823
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,167
[chuckles]

824
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,042
[phone buzzes]

825
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,083
What the…

826
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,000
[sighs]

827
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,875
[huffs]

828
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:58,625
-Hello.
-Deniz, how are you, sweetie?

829
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,625
You never return my calls

830
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:05,167
but when I saw the photo,
I wanted to congratulate you, dear.

831
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,292
What?

832
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,125
You made up with Güneş.

833
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,542
I knew it.

834
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,042
I knew it all along.

835
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,667
You are the perfect match.

836
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,542
I hope Cappadocia will do you good.

837
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,375
May your new house bring you blessings.

838
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,000
What? New house?

839
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,000
I took care of your reservations.

840
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:25,417
You will receive the check-in link soon.

841
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,083
Oh, you know what? I knew.

842
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,167
I could feel it.

843
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,708
Güneş keeps talking about your breakup,
yet she can't hide her feelings.

844
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:34,167
I know when I see true love.

845
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,833
-I know all about love. [chuckles]
-What?

846
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:42,542
-Is Güneş in love with someone?
-[laughs] Oh, Deniz. Come on, admit it.

847
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,625
You love hearing someone say
that Güneş loves you.

848
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:46,833
Just be honest.

849
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,333
All right, sweetheart.

850
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:53,583
I have an idea,
but I wanted to discuss it with you first.

851
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,542
Fine, let's talk. I'm listening.

852
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,458
You know how everyone
is dying to see your face.

853
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:02,250
I say let's make it happen in Cappadocia.

854
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,958
Let's reveal Mr. Alpha
to all the followers!

855
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,833
What do you think, Deniz?

856
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:10,125
Pervin, what are you talking about?
I really don't get it.

857
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:12,458
Güneş writes an article
about the house in Cappadocia.

858
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:15,500
And then, she can post a photo
like the one she shared today

859
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,250
but one where your face is seen.

860
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,958
Telling everyone, "This is Mr. Alpha."

861
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:22,042
What do you think?

862
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:23,958
It's phenomenal, right? It's huge!

863
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,542
So you're saying Güneş
posted a photo of Mr. Alpha,

864
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:31,958
and she's in love?

865
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,208
Where the hell is it?

866
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,458
